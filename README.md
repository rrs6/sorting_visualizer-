# Sorting Visualizer
A sorting visualizer made by me, with the visualization of the four main sort algorithms (Quicksort, Mergesort, Selection Sort and Insertion Sort). 
The project was made in ReactJS as a way to learn some Framework concepts. I've always liked to create stuff about programming skills (This project is first).
